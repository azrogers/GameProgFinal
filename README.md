# GameProgFinal

My final for a Game Programming I class I took back in 2018, in my second semester of sophomore year. I used it as an excuse to create my own engine based on OpenGL and SDL, emulating the structure of Unity (which I was most familiar with at the time). I'm fairly proud of it still, so I thought I'd finally upload it.
